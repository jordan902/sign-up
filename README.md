A sign-up form, created using html, css and javascript.

This form checks for the following requirements by using conditional statement: if, else
1. Passwords must mach eachother
2. Passwords must have one lower case letter
3. Passwords must have one upper case letter
4. Passwords must be over 8 characters long
5. Phone number must be 10 numbers only

When all requirements are met, the form submits and refreshes.

Using html & css to design the interface, the page is seperate with a left(hero) side, and a right(form) side.
By centering a div behind a div I was able to create the hero side with a banner across the center.
Using the form element in html, I was able to set up the form input structure while styling it with css.
